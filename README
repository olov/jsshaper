JSShaper is an extensible framework for JavaScript syntax tree
shaping, created by Olov Lassus <olov.lassus@gmail.com>.

JSShaper and its plugins are implemented in JavaScript. Syntax tree
shaping means performing complex manipulations to a syntax tree
representation of your textual source code, and then turning it back
into source code again. JSShaper goes very far to keep all your source
code formatting, intendation, whitespace and comments.

JSShaper comes with the following plugins:
  annotation-printer: prints /* @annotations */
  bitwiser: static analysis. requires @bitwise annotation for the
  bitwise operators | (or), & (and), to detect misspelling of the
  logical operators ||, &&.
  stringconverter: detects the ""+expr pattern and turns it into String(expr)
  restricter: adds run-time checking for restrict mode programs by
  converting operators into function calls in a compatible way. it
  comes with a small run-time library.

It also comes with a few small and simple examples.

JSShaper is young, not very documented, and may crash with horrible
error messages. Thanks for being an early adopter and reporting bugs or
annoyances. Contributors are welcome!

JSShaper is designed to run from the command line. It should be
possible to use with the following JS shells:
  js: recent versions of Mozilla SpiderMonkey/TraceMonkey
  d8: Google V8 debug shell
  node: Embedded V8 with lots more

It doesn't work with the JavaScriptCore jsc shell since it has no load
function.

Run it like this (replace d8 with your preferred shell):
d8 run-shaper.js -- filename [shape1 .. shapeN]
  where shape is a plugin (see plugins/) or --builtin (--tree or --source)
example: d8 run-shaper.js -- myfile.js plugins/annotater.js plugins/bitwiser.js --source
example: d8 run-shaper.js -- myfile.js plugins/annotater.js plugins/restricter.js --source

For restricter, you can also run the more convenient run-restricter:
example: d8 run-restricter.js -- myfile.js
